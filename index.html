                                <strong>Smt.Mangalam Ganapathy</strong>, an ordinary housewife with no formal training in music and proficiency in any language, at the age of 64 years, is suddenly bestowed by divine grace, with powers to create compositions of the highest order in classical mould in carnatic music.

                                    We have with us a great composer Smt.Mangalam Ganapathy whose innate sense of music with abundant blessings of Lord Ganesha, pours forth into mellifluous compositions clothed in chaste text be it Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Hindi with excellent melody. She is a complete vaggeyakara (composer) called as Uththama as she creates both the Sahithya and Sangitha at the same time.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                What is amazing is her ability to write, the lyrics set to a particular raga, tala on any one of the hundreds of the godheads of the Hindu pantheon and that too in one of the five languages all at the same time.
                            </p>
                            <p align="justify">
                                The genre of carnatic music she has covered in her compositions ranges from varnam, krithis, ragamalikas, thillanas, devotional bhajans etc. 
                            </p>
                            <p align="justify">
                                It is truly mind blowing to consider the alarming speed with which she has written more than six thousand compositions in 9 years from 1998 (which must be a record of sorts amongst living composers).
                            </p>
                            <p align="justify">
                                What can we call her - <em>A Musical Miracle</em>
                                or <em>Musical Marvel</em>
                                or both?

                                She has won the acclaim of the doyens of carnatic music, musicians, musicologists and reviewers.

                                    Her heart is pregnant with celestial fire. No wonder her inventing prowess is unstoppable. Thorough in matrix of traditional songs, this gifted composer has, in all her compositions, succeeded in providing great scope for the expansion of our divine cognizance. Through a combination of personal integration and the song element, the composer has found means of getting glimpses of the eternity. Her ideal is spelt out in the following quote:
